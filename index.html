        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Whew!" whistled Joe Matson, the astonishment on his bronzed face being indicated by his surprised exclamation of:</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Well, what do you know about that, Sis?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"What is it, Joe?" asked his sister Clara, as she looked up from a letter she was reading to see her brother staring at a sheet of paper he had just withdrawn from an envelope, for the morning mail had been delivered a few minutes before. "What is it?" the girl went on, laying aside her own correspondence. "Is it anything serious—anything about father's business? Don't tell me there is more trouble, Joe!"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"I'm not going to, Clara. It isn't trouble, but, if what he says is true, it's going to make a big difference to me," and Joe looked out of the window, across a snowy expanse of yard, and gazed at, without consciously seeing, a myriad of white flakes swirling down through the wintry air.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"No, it isn't exactly trouble," went on Joe, "and I suppose I ought to be corkingly glad of it; but I hadn't counted on leaving the Central Baseball League quite so soon."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Oh, Joe! Have you lost your place?" exclaimed Clara. "And just after you have done so well, too; and helped them win the pennant! I call that a shame! I thought baseball men were better 'sports' than that."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Listen to her—my little sister using slang!" laughed Joe.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"'Sports' isn't slang," defended Clara. "I've heard lots of girls use it. I mean it in the right sense. But have you really lost your place on the team, Joe?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Well, not exactly, Sis, but I'm about to, I'm afraid. However, I guess I may as well make the best of it, and be glad. I sure can use the extra money!"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"I certainly don't know what you're talking about," went on Clara, with a helpless look at her big, handsome brother, "and I suppose you'll take your own time in telling me. But I would like to know what it all means, Joe. And about extra money. Who's going to give it to you?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Nobody. I'll have to earn it with this pitching arm of mine," and the young baseball player swung it around, as though "winding-up" for a swift delivery.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Look out, Joe!" cried Clara, but she gave the warning too late.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">At that moment Mrs. Matson entered the room with a jug of water, which she intended pouring on a window-box of flowers. Joe's arm struck the jug a glancing blow, and sent it flying, the water spraying over the floor, and the jug itself falling, and cracking into many pieces.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">For a moment there was a momentous silence, after two startled screams—one each from Mrs. Matson and Clara. Then Joe cried gaily:</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Out at first! Say, Momsey, I hope I didn't hit you!"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"No, you didn't," and she laughed now. "But what does it all mean? Are you practicing so early in the season? Oh, my carpet! It will be ruined!" she went on, as she saw the water. "But I'm glad I didn't bring in a good jug. Did you hurt your hand?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Nary a hurt," said Joe, with a smile. "Ha! I'll save you from a wetting!" he exclaimed, as he stooped quickly and picked up an unopened letter, the address of which was in a girlish hand.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Get the mop, while you're at it," advised Clara. A little later Joe had sopped up the water, and quiet was restored.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"And now suppose you tell us all about it," suggested Mrs. Mason. "Why were you practicing gymnastics, Joe?" and she smiled at her athletic son.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"I was just telling Clara that my pitching arm was likely to bring me in more money this year, Momsey, and I was giving it a twirl, when you happened to get in my way. Now I'll tell you all about it. It's this letter," and Joe held out the one he had been reading.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Are you sure it isn't the other?" asked Clara, with a sly look at her brother, for she had glanced at the writing on the unopened envelope Joe had picked up from the floor. "Let me read that other letter, Joe," she teased.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"A little later—maybe!" he parried. "But this one," and he fluttered the open sheet in his hand, "this one is from Mr. Gregory, manager of the Pittston team, with whom I have the honor to be associated," and Joe bowed low to his mother and sister. "Mr. Gregory gives me a bit of news. It is nothing less than that the manager of the St. Louis Nationals is negotiating for the services of yours truly—your humble servant, Joseph Matson," and again the young ball player bowed, and laughed.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Joe, you don't mean it!" cried his sister. "You're going to belong to a major league team!" for Clara was almost as ardent a baseball "fan" as was her brother.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Well, it looks like it, Sis," replied Joe, slowly, as he glanced at the letter again. "Of course it isn't settled, but Mr. Gregory says I'm pretty sure to be drafted to St. Louis."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Drafted!" exclaimed his mother. "That sounds like war times, when they used to draft men to go to the front. Do you mean you haven't any choice in the matter, Joe?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Well, that's about it, Momsey," the young man explained. "You see, baseball is pretty well organized. It has to be, to make it the success it is," he added frankly, "though lots of people are opposed to the system. But I haven't been in it long enough to find fault, even if I wanted to—which I don't."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"But it seems queer that you can't stay with the Pittston team if you want to," said Mrs. Matson.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"I don't know as I want to," spoke Joe, slowly, "especially when I'll surely get more money with St. Louis, besides having the honor of pitching for a major league team, even if it isn't one of the top-notchers, and a pennant winner. So if they want to draft me, let them do their worst!" and he laughed, showing his even, white teeth.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"You see," he resumed, "when I signed a contract with the Pittstons, of the Central League, I gave them the right to control my services as long as I played baseball. I had to agree not to go to any other team without permission, and, in fact, no other organized team would take me unless the Pittston management released me. I went into it with my eyes open.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"And, you see, the Pittston team, being one of the small ones, has to give way to a major league team. That is, any major league team, like the St. Louis Nationals, can call for, or draft, any player in a smaller team. So if they call me I'll have to go. And I'll be glad to. I'll get more money and fame.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"That is, I hope I will," and Joe spoke more soberly. "I know I'm not going to have any snap of it. It's going to be hard work from the word go, for there will be other pitchers on the St. Louis team, and I'll have to do my best to make a showing against them.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"And I will, too!" cried Joe, resolutely. "I'll make good, Momsey!"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"I hope so, my son," she responded, quietly. "You know I was not much in favor of your taking up baseball for a living, but I must say you have done well at it, and after all, if one does one's best at anything, that is what counts. So I hope you make good with the St. Louis team—I suppose 'make good' is the proper expression," she added, with a smile.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"It'll do first-rate, Momsey," laughed Joe. "Now let's see what else Gregory says."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">He glanced over the letter again, and remarked:</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Well, there's nothing definite. The managers are laying their plans for the Spring work, and he says I'm being considered. He adds he will be sorry to lose me."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"I should think he would be!" exclaimed Clara, a flush coming into her cheeks. "You were the best pitcher on his team!"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Oh, I wouldn't go as far as to say that!" cried Joe, "though I appreciate your feeling, Sis. I had a good bit of luck, winning some of the games the way I did. Well, I guess I'll go look up some St. Louis records, and see what I'm expected to do in the batting average line compared with them," the player went on. "The St. Louis team isn't a wonder, but it's done pretty fair at times, I believe, and it's a step up for me. I'll be more in line for a place on the New York Giants, or the Philadelphia Athletics if I make a good showing in Missouri," finished Joe.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">He started from the room, carrying the two letters, one of which he had not yet opened.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Who's it from?" asked Clara, with a smile, as she pointed to the heavy, square envelope in his hand.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Oh, one of my many admirers," teased Joe. "I can't tell just which one until I open it. And, just to satisfy your curiosity, I'll do so now," and he proceeded to slit the envelope with his pocket-knife.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Oh, it's from Mabel Varley!" he exclaimed.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Just as if you didn't know all the while!" scoffed Clara. "You wouldn't forget her handwriting so soon, Joe Matson."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Um!" he murmured, non-committally. "Why, this is news!" he cried, suddenly. "Mabel and her brother Reggie are coming here!"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Here!" exclaimed Clara. "To visit us?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Oh, no, not that exactly," Joe went on. "They're on a trip, it seems, and they're going to stop off here for a day or so. Mabel says they'll try to see us. I hope they will."</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"I've never met them," observed Clara.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"No," spoke Joe, musingly. "Well, you may soon. Why!" he went on, "they're coming to-day—on the afternoon express. I must go down to the station to meet them, though the train is likely to be late, if this snow keeps up. Whew! see it come down!" and he went over to the window and looked out.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"It's like a small blizzard," remarked Clara, "and it seems to be growing worse. Doesn't look much like baseball; does it, Joe?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"I should say not! Say, I believe I'll go down to the station, anyhow, and see what the prospects are. Want to come, Sis?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"No, thank you. Not in this storm. Where are the Varleys going to stop?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"At the hotel. Reggie has some business in town, Mabel writes. Well, I sure will be glad to see him again!"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Him? Her, you mean!" laughed Clara. "Oh, Joe, you are so simple!"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Humph!" he exclaimed, as he put the two letters into his pocket—both of great importance to him. "Well, I'll go down to the station."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Joe was soon trudging through the storm on the way to the depot.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"The St. Louis 'Cardinals'!" he mused, as he bent his head to the blast, thinking of the letters in his pocket. "I didn't think I'd be in line for a major league team so soon. I wonder if I can make good?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Thinking alternately of the pleasure he would have in seeing Miss Mabel Varley, a girl in whom he was more than ordinarily interested, and of the new chance that had come to him, Joe soon reached the depot. His inquiries about the trains were not, however, very satisfactorily answered.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"We can't tell much about them in this storm," the station master said. "All our trains are more or less late. Stop in this afternoon, and I may have some definite information for you."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And later that day, when it was nearly arrival time for the train on which Mabel and Reggie were to come, Joe received some news that startled him.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"There's no use in your waiting, Joe," said the station master, as the young ball player approached him again. "Your train won't be in to-day, and maybe not for several days."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Why? What's the matter—a wreck?" cried Joe, a vision of injured friends looming before him.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Not exactly a wreck, but almost as bad," went on the official. "The train is stalled—snowed in at Deep Rock Cut, five miles above here, and there's no chance of getting her out."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">"Great Scott!" cried Joe. "The express snowed in! Why, I've got friends on that train! I wonder what I can do to help them?"</p>

    passage: `
      <div class="passage-container">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-700">Passage B</h3>
        
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">I grew up in Providence, Rhode Island, and for my entire childhood, we were never more than twenty miles away from the core of our universe, the Kennedys. We were Irish; they were Irish. We were Catholic; they were Catholic. They were family. We were like the relatives that they never got to see, but we knew they were busy and we knew that they loved us. So anything that was happening to them was also happening to us.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Their tragedy plus our own tragedy was a lot. So this one Thanksgiving after dinner and a family fight at Grandma's house, we were in the car driving home, and the radio was playing this tenth anniversary of the JFK assassination. I'm sitting in the back seat and I start to cry.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">My sister Erin says, "Hey Dad, Mikayla's crying."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And my father pulls that car right over to the shoulder of I-95. He stops it. He turns around and he looks at us, and with tears in his own eyes he says, "Don't you ever be ashamed to cry for that man."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">My parents grew up near Newport and they got married in the same exact church as Jack and Jackie: St. Mary's. And my father gave exact replica jewelry to my mother that were replications of the jewelry that Jack gave to Jackie. And every Saturday night after mass, my family would be in the living room and we'd be happily ever aftering to the original soundtrack of Camelot.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And every year during the seventies, my four aunts would take me and my two cousins on their dream vacation: a rented beach house in Hyannis on the very cove sharing beachfront with the Kennedy Compound.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Every day for an entire week, my Aunt Pat would roll up her sisters' hair. My aunts would apply sunscreen to the back of their necks, the backs of their hands, and the tops of their feet, and then they would drag their beach chairs down to the beach. And they would set them up perfectly, not facing the water, not into the sun for tanning, but perfectly for spying on the Kennedys. They would sit there all day in the broiling sun with high-powered binoculars and keep a constant surveillance.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And every year they'd have the same exact conversations, usually around mid-morning. The first sighting would be made, usually by my Aunt Pat. She'd say, "Ah, they got Rose out walking. Ethel looks drawn."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And then about an hour later my Aunt Gurt would say, "How old is Rose now?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And Aunt Momo would make the calculations, "Well let's see. Jack died in sixty-three when she was seventy-four, and Rose's birthday was two weeks last Thursday, and Joe died in sixty-nine, making her a widow at eighty-one. So eighty-five."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And then they'd break for lunch.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">After lobster and drawn butter and hosing us down, they'd all huff back to their posts, and they'd watch. And every now and then there'd be something they didn't know: "Hey, who's that? Who's that? Who's that?" So they'd draw out the family tree in the sand. They'd analyze it; they'd come up with a profile and they'd crack the code: "It's one of Bobby's."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Now any mention of Bobby would always bring up the inevitable, "Oh, I just pray to God they don't tell poor senile Rose about Bobby. It'll break her."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So then the long afternoon stretch would end with the inevitable annual observation: "You don't see Jackie much here." And then all of my aunts would drop their binoculars and look at each other meaningfully.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Now all of this meant that no one was paying any attention to me and my cousins in the water. And the summer when we were nine years old, we found something.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Had an aunt perhaps, in an effort to ease a cramp in her prying neck, just sort of glanced towards the water, she might have seen us climbing into this tiny, plastic, half-inflated boat. She might have cried out in alarm at the lack of oars and life vests. She might have had a conniption fit to see us shove off and drift into the violent riptide that would sweep us within five minutes out to the open sea and the Nantucket-bound ferry. But an aunt didn't, and we did.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">It all happened so fast that we were swept out. It wasn't until we realized that we could make out the specific features of the ferry passengers that we knew we were really far from shore. We were so far from shore that my aunts were now reduced to four hopping dots. Uh oh. It was like Gilligan's Island for real.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So an Atlantic swell crashes over our heads, and as soon as the water clears out of our eyes, a power boat pulls up out of nowhere. And in this power boat are David and Michael Kennedy.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">David and Michael pull us up into the boat, and we are like, "Oh my God, we are saved by a power boat!"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So the power boat sends us back to shore and we're psyched, 'cause we're saved—until we start to watch the four hopping dots morph back into our four crazed, livid aunts. We are so gonna get it.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">My family under any circumstances has this really weird thing. Well, they each have like their own weird thing about yelling and getting into huge trouble. Like my Aunt Gurt, she gets so freaked out that all she can do is yell out our addresses, like, "Ilene and Kevin, 275 Hooper Street! Mikayla, 180 Asylum Road!" (I swear to God I grew up on Asylum Road, a very telling piece of my childhood). Or my Aunt Pat would do these things where she would say things that were actually kind of nice, but she'd say them like they were death threats. She'd be like, "Yeah, I'll save you from drowning! You get on that beach towel and you lie in that sun, now!" Or she'd say, "I'm gonna buy you a birthday present! You eat that cake, now!"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So we knew that this was what was coming; the Kennedy boys didn't. So they're vivaciously tanned, and they pull up to the shoreline and we brace ourselves.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Now what happens is our aunts are out of their minds. They're ready to flay us, but when they see us in the same boat as the Kennedys, it's like they don't have the emotional capacity to handle it. They kinda snap. They're kinda like freaking out to yell at us, but they start fake smiling and trying to act all normal.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And my Aunt Momo, she takes on this Kennedy-esque way of speaking, which is sort of halfway between Katharine Hepburn and like the Queen of England. And we're looking at them like, what are you guys doing? And they're smiling this smile. But when they smile at us, it's like, "You just wait." But they're like, "Oh, David! Oh, Michael! Thank you, thank you, thank you!" And they're not mad at us for almost drowning. They're mad at us because the Kennedys had to save us. Don't those people have enough trouble? As if our almost drowning was yet another Kennedy tragedy.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So these poor boys finally pull and pry themselves away from my aunts. They get back on the boat, and they're leaving. And my Aunt Momo's going, "Please give our best to your grandmother."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And now it's time for our for-real punishment, which was that we for the rest of vacation had to stay on the beach, because we did not have any respect for the water.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So it's a hundred degrees out, and after about a half hour of whining and fighting and emptying out all the Coppertone and kicking sand, we break my Aunt Pat's last nerve. And she says, "Alright, you can go in the water, but only up to your knees."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So we're happy for a minute until we get in the water and realize how boring "up to your knees" is. And then we get the great plan of having chicken fights. So we start to have chicken fights, but it's kinda weird because there's only three of us. But we're doing the best we can to have a chicken fight like that and knock each other off into the water. So we get fully immersed.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And then my Uncle Al, who never, ever played with us, ever, comes into the water to play chicken fights with us. And he puts his daughter, my cousin Ilene, up on his shoulders, and then I get up on my cousin Kevin's shoulders, and we're having chicken fights and it's like actual family fun for a moment. And we're hitting each other, falling in the water, and then I take my foot and I accidentally kick the side of my Uncle Al's head, really, really hard.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And his eyeball pops out of his head, falls into the water, and sinks. It pops out of his head, and it sinks.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Ilene, Kevin, and I are in instant, complete shock. Right this minute there is still a part of me that is on that beach screaming. It's like, "Oh my God! We had no idea that he had a fake eye! We didn't even know that you could have a fake eye! Why would you have a fake eye?" They didn't tell us that Uncle Al had a fake eye 'cause they didn't want us blabbing it to the whole neighborhood. So they didn't tell us, so we didn't know. And like, later on, you know, there was Columbo and Sandy Duncan, but this was way before that. We had no idea.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So we're all standing there and it's like so horrible. I can't even. I'm like, "Oh my God." And my cousins Ilene and Kevin are staring at me with complete hate, like, "You broke our dad!"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And my Uncle Al is standing there and he's got the lid open, so you can see inside the socket where now it's just like skin and the eyeball gone. And you cannot just say "I'm sorry" to someone that you just... so I don't know what to do.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And my Aunt Pat is hysterically screaming because that eyeball cost top dollar. It was a special magnetized eye so it could keep up with the other one, and now I had just better pray that vacation was over and that they got that deposit back, because now they were gonna have to buy a brand new top-dollar eye that was not in the budget.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So I just didn't know what to do. I was like, "My life is over. I am no longer Mikayla. I am now 'Merce Girl Who Kicked Al's Eye Out in the Cape'." And it's awful and everybody's just crying and pointing at me and now my other aunts are getting in on it, like, in the "who's-the-blame" part of the conversation's happening.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So I just kind of back off into the water. I'm kinda like going back and regressing back to where life as I once knew it had ended. And I just stand there and I'm like, "I kinda wish I had drowned, and I kinda wish the Kennedys hadn't saved me."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And I bent off and into the waves, and I just start sifting through sand and shells and pebbles and it's totally ridiculous. But I will never stop looking for this eye, I am gonna look forever. And I keep looking and looking, and I'm sifting through, and then all of a sudden, there is an eyeball in my palm staring right at me.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And so I scream and I drop it back and it sinks back into the water.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">But now we know it's possible, so everybody gets back into the water and now we're all sifting through and sifting through. And I pray to God for no more future happiness until we find this eye, and I also kinda pray that it not be me the one that finds it this time.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So after like an hour, my cousin Kevin finds the eye, and he holds it up in triumph. And he does not let go.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And my Uncle Al takes the eye. He washes it off and just pops it back in, and then he kinda like tests it, you know, and it's like keeping up with the other one, so it's working still. And now it's the weirdest thing because now we know it's a fake eye, and now that you know it's a fake eye, it totally looks like a fake eye. And I can't believe that I never noticed it wasn't a fake eye before.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So now vacation's back on, and everybody gets back in their beach chairs and they start to settle down to begin telling the story over and over like a million times about what I just did.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And I have not really fully reintegrated back into the family yet. I'm kind of standing apart, and I notice that there actually has been like kind of a group of people who have been watching this whole thing. And then I see something that I didn't notice, that no one noticed, and that's that two of the Kennedy kids, David and Michael, had taken a walk on the beach. And I can tell just by the look on their faces that they had sat there and seen the entire episode, that they had been there watching us.</p>

      <div class="passage-container">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-blue-700">Passage C</h3>
        
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">It's the last unit of the year; I'm teaching third grade. And the last unit is the Oregon Trail. I am prepared to have my students really live the Oregon Trail. This is how I taught third grade: I would create a world and then run it like a puppet master. A lot of those times, those worlds were goofy. Like we always had a game; we got letters from a stuffed animal rock band named Antic Leia and the Howlers who were lost across the United States. We were studying geography, so to help them, we had to study the states. We got letters from time machines. My characters had names like Cheesy De Pizza and Caesar Von Salad. I was not a serious teacher.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">But now this is the Oregon Trail. This is a serious time, and this is also a really complicated time in American history. To be totally honest, I'm not sure I can get at the historical and moral complexities of westward expansion with nine-year-olds. They have trouble taking the perspective of their little sister. So I'm not really sure I can do that, but I know I can get at the gravity of it, right? This is pioneers. Two thousand miles across the United States—which weren't the United States yet—across the Rockies, leaving everything they know, risking everything they have. Blizzards and hunger and all these things. So at least I can get it's really real, and at least I can get my kids to feel like it's really real.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So I come to my class and I say, "We're gonna be doing the Oregon Trail."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And this one smart aleck kid named Alex says, "Well, will it be a game?" because he knows it's always a game.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And I say, "Yeah, but it's gonna be a dangerous game." And they're pretty psyched about that.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">What I've planned is a simulation: we're gonna take on characters of pioneers and we're going to travel the Oregon Trail on a wagon train. So first we have to choose names for our characters. I downloaded and printed the names of real people who died on the Oregon Trail. It's pretty authentic. And so they can have their first names but they have to have last names like Chapman and Blunderfield, and Alex is now Alex Bacon.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And then they have to choose occupations, and all the girls want to be pop stars. And I tell them, "There were no pop stars on the Oregon Trail. Choose authentic occupations from the eighteen-forties." So, okay, great. There are farmers and there are gold miners and there's a couple of doctors, and we're good.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">But before we start, I want them to feel what it really felt like to walk for that long. So I was here in Manhattan. I took them on a forty-block walk. It's about two miles. It's not that long. It's long if you're a nine-year-old, I guess.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And it's a beautiful day, you know, we're going up the west side, we're going up the Hudson. And Alex Bacon says to me, "Well, I wouldn't have had to walk. I would have ridden in the wagon."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And I said, "Aha. No, no. Children never rode in the wagons. The wagons were for if there was someone sick, or our supplies, or if we had a piano." 'Cause I had done my research.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And then another kid says, "Well, I'm thirsty."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And I say, "Well, there were no water fountains on the Oregon Trail."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And he says, "Well, there's a water fountain right there."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And I think about the parent phone call. I do not want to get one about withholding water from a child. And I think fast and I say, "Ah! A stream! How fortunate. Let us partake."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So we finally get back and we're hot and sweaty, but we're ready. We're ready to go on our journey. And the way I designed it is... Previously, all of my games were just fiction. Like I would just write a letter and then they would respond, and I would write another letter that night. I always knew what was gonna happen. But now I want to play a little more dangerously, because it was all luck what happened on the Oregon Trail, right?</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So I have designed a game of chance. I've combined the Oregon Trail video game with principles of Dungeons and Dragons, the role-playing game with dice. Every day I'm gonna tell them what happened on the trail that day. They're gonna make some choices about what they wanna do. And then we're gonna roll dice to see if they succeeded or failed.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So I'll give you an example. We get to a river and they have to decide. Do they wanna pay a ferryman or do they want to ford their wagons? And they decide to ford their wagons. We roll to find out if their wagons sink or floated. That kind of thing. So it's easy. Great.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">The first day starts, and I have this bonnet that I've sewn out of old upholstery material, and I put on this bonnet, and I tell them, "I am Mary, your wagon train captain. We are all here for different reasons, but we will have to work together to get through the bad weather and the hunger and the wild animals that await us."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And Alex Bacon says, "Excuse me Mary, this is a dangerous game. Could we die?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">I was a little in character at that point. And I will also admit I wanted to take Alex down a peg. So I said, "Sure, people died on the Oregon Trail all the time. Someone might die."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And this shiver of excitement goes across my class. They liked my stuffed animal rock band, but they are into danger. I know I'm not gonna let anyone die. Like, I'm not gonna let it get there, right? No one's gonna die on the Oregon Trail, but the idea that someone might gets them wanting to come to social studies every day. So this is okay.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">We're off. We're tracking our mileage, we're rolling dice, we're making tough choices.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">At some point, I have them meet a snake oil salesman who offers to sell them an elixir that will make them stronger and faster and get to Oregon City quicker. And something you need to know about nine-year-olds: a lot of them, pretty much all of them, don't know what snake oil salesmen are. I say this to you and you know this is shorthand for like a con man, right? But to them it's just someone else they don't know about, like taxes, like that. It's just a thing, like a grown-up thing: snake oil salesman.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So they decide to buy the elixir 'cause they wanna go get there faster. So we roll to see how much stronger and faster they got, and of course we all know the answer is none faster. It's snake oil. So I tell them, "Actually, that was a con. You are throwing up for a day. You lose a day of travel." And I think they're gonna be really annoyed that they got slowed down, but they are psyched. They got to throw up in social studies. They're talking about it for days. My game is a hit.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">The problem is, every day before we start, someone says to me, "Is someone gonna die today? Is someone gonna die today?" And I've been putting them off and putting them off, but my game is going so well and we're getting towards the Rockies. And I figure, you know what, I'm gonna give them just a brush with death.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So I write out a bunch of possibilities for that day. And the next time someone asks me if someone's gonna die today, I say, "We have been lucky thus far, but the Rockies lie ahead, the most treacherous part of our journey. Who knows what might happen."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So I put on the bonnet, and that's what I did. I loved that action.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And I set the scene for the morning, "In the early morning light, on a Rocky Mountain pass, a wagon hits a rock and is overturned. Someone is trapped beneath the wagon. Let us roll to find out who it is." I'm not proud of this.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">I take off the bonnet and we have like a system of rules to figure out. Different kids have different numbers and I roll, and it's this little girl Katie I know. Her Oregon Trail name is Katherine Chubbuck. She's a farmer. She's one of these kids who always has really messy hair and sounds like she's been smoking since she was three. And she has to come to the front of the class and I say, "Katherine Chubbuck, your legs have been trapped beneath the wagon. Roll to find out if you get free and what happens."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And she rolls, and she gets free. But her legs have been infected. I wrote these possibilities and this is the first time I'm thinking, "Why did I write that possibility?" This is getting really dark.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And I say, "Katherine Chubbuck, roll to find out if your infection gets better or worse."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And she rolls, and it gets worse, and she looks at me and just goes, "Did I die?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And as soon as she says it, I realize how much trouble I am in. I haven't written any more possibilities. I didn't think we would get this far. So what happens next? Do we have a funeral on the side of the Oregon Trail for Katherine Chubbuck? Is that the parent phone call that I get for having traumatized a girl for killing her on the Oregon Trail? "Bad teachers kill kids on the Oregon Trail." And I am not a bad teacher, or so I thought. This is all the stuff that's happening in my head. A lot of it is very existential.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And then all of a sudden, from the back of the class, this little girl Ellis whose Oregon Trail name is Dr. Ellis Chapman just goes, "Wait, I'm a doctor!"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And I'm like, "Thank the Lord."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">Dr. Chapman brings her doctor bag. She knows how to heal the wound. Ellis Chapman comes up to the front of the room. I say, "The only way you roll to find out what happens, the only way you die is if you roll a six. That's the only way you die."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">The class is holding their breath. As Katie rolls, she does the lucky shake thing and then someone just goes, "Shake them again!" She shakes, and she rolls, and it's a three, and she survives.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">I know, in my class it's like the end of Apollo 13. Kids are throwing papers in the air and hugging each other, and Ellis is hugging Katie, and Katie's just going, "I almost died. I almost died." And I am so glad we agreed to bring a doctor on the Oregon Trail with us. She couldn't hunt, but she was very useful.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">The problem is... So that was great. The problem is, we still have seven hundred and twenty miles to Oregon City, and I'm exhausted. I can't remember a time before we were walking the Oregon Trail.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And the next day, you know I had all the stuff planned, and the next day I get to class, I put my bonnet on, I tell them, "We hear animal noises in the bushes." And Alex Bacon is right on it. He goes, "Is it wild animals? Are we in danger?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And he says it, and I realize they love the danger. I'm the one who doesn't want the danger. And I throw my plan out the window. It was wild animals and we were in danger, actually, but I forget about that. I say, "No, it is a baby animal with a broken leg, who we must adopt for the rest of the trip."</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And they all do the third-grade baby animal noise, which is, "Aw." And I say, "Let us roll to find out what species of baby animal we will be adopting. Is it a baby bunny, a baby fox, or a baby wolf?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">It's a baby wolf. They name him Yenny the Benny. They love him very much, and he follows us all the way to Oregon.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And we get to Oregon in record time. I mean, forget pioneers walking. This is Amazon Prime, two-day shipping, to get to Oregon City. Nothing bad happens between the Rockies and Oregon City, and when we get there, we do homestead and we do our budget. So we do all that stuff, but we also make cornbread, and we have a dance party to "September" by Earth, Wind and Fire, which is not historically accurate. But that is the kind of Oregon Trail I wanna be on at that point.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">So that's the Oregon Trail. But I have to tell you guys, about a year ago I ran into Katie on the street on Broadway, and she's in ninth grade now. She looks exactly the same except that she's been stretched, you know. And I recognized her right away and she recognized me, and we hugged and I said, "How are you?" And the first thing she said to me was, "Do you remember when I almost died on the Oregon Trail?"</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-800">And I said, "Yeah Katie, I absolutely remember."</p>
